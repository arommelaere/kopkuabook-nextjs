the website is two language: english and thai, always code with english, thai will be translated later.

the name is kopkuabook and the domain is kopkuabook.com

each user can login then click on the person book they want to add content, then see what others family members posted, and can post their own content, up to the monthly book limit and its subscription plan limits.
